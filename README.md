# studyAssistant
A web application that increases productivity during study/work sessions.

This project incorporates three features I find particularly helpful to stimulate focus.
  1. The Pomodoro Technique
  2. Spotify's Chill Lofi Study Beats playlist
  3. A to-do list

# What I Accomplished

* Utilized JavaScript to handle user interaction of a responsive timer and list.
* Integrated a Spotify playlist within the browser.
* Built a clean UI/UX design layout with HTML/CSS.
